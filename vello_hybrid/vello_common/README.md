This crate contains core data structures and utilities shared across the Vello rendering. It includes common geometry representations, tiling logic, and other fundamental components used by both `vello_cpu` and `vello_hybrid`.

## Features

- Geometry processing utilities
- Common logic for rendering stages

## Usage
This crate acts as a foundation for `vello_cpu` and `vello_hybrid`, providing essential components to minimize duplication.

## Minimum supported Rust Version (MSRV)
